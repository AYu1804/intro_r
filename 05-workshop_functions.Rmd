---

# In the console

Either in the script or in the console, typing ? before the function and run if the package is loaded:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?ggsave
```

Or if the package hasn't been loaded using the package::function() format:

```{r eval=FALSE}
??beepr::beep # loaded in the Cloud

# Let's revisit our dplyr session:

</br> The mean number of beds available by date

```{r eval=TRUE}
beds_data %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE))

```

</br> Output = Object = New data frame!

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Next step: Visualise

---

# Piecing it together

We can put the output...

```{r }

    beds_data %>%
         group_by(date) %>% 
         summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE)) 

```

</br> ... into ggplot2 code...

```{r}
ggplot(
         beds_data %>% #<<
         group_by(date) %>% #<<
         summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
) + 
   geom_point(aes(x = date, y = mean_beds))

```

class: center, middle

# But, it's often better to:

## Keep wrangling separate

---

class: center, middle

# And it's <ins>always</ins> better to:

## Keep your code .green[as] readable .green[as possible]

---

# Solution:

This whole 'chunk' of code can be named

```{r}
# name = 

beds_data %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE))

```

--

</br> With this:

```{r}
beds_ts <- beds_data %>% #<<
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE))

```

---

# Good (object) names are:

</br> 1. Descriptive
</br>
</br> 2. Short.blue[(ish)]
</br>
</br> 3. Consistent .blue[with other names]

--

</br> 
</br> Whilst = will work, R convention is to use the following assignment operator:

```{r eval=FALSE}
<- 
```

Shortcut: <kbd> Alt - </kbd>
---

# What happens when the code is run?

The code creates an object which can be seen in the top right quadrant Environment pane

<img class="center" src="img/session07/object-creation.PNG" width="40%"/>

And this can be viewed by running the code line:

```{r}
beds_ts
```

---
# Returning to the plot

The long code used to create the dataset

```{r}
ggplot(data = beds_data %>% #<<
         group_by(date) %>% #<<
         summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE))) + #<<
     geom_point(aes(x = date, y = mean_beds)) #<<
```

--

</br> 
Becomes...

```{r}
ggplot(data = beds_ts) + #<<
     geom_point(aes(x = date, y = mean_beds))
```

---

# Your turn

Give your plot a name

```{r}
# plot = 

ggplot(data = beds_ts) +
     geom_point(aes(x = date, y = mean_beds))

```

Then run your plot

```{r}
# plot
```

---

# Solution

```{r}

plot <- ggplot(data = beds_ts) + #<<
     geom_point(aes(x = date, y = mean_beds))

plot #<<
```

---

# Naming style

The way names are written out is a question of style but it's best to be consistent. 

The two common forms in R are camelCase and snake_case but others are:

```{r}
camelCase # first letter is small case

PascalCase # every letter is capital

snake_case # lower case and words are separated with underline

kebab-case # lower case and hyphen, used in RMarkdown but not R scripts
```
